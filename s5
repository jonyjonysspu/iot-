Skill-5:
Interface ESP32 with DHT11 sensor and upload data to a webpage using Blynk

Skills/Competencies Acquired:
Interfacing of DHT11 sensor
Working with Blynk
Configuring ESP32 Wi-Fi
Writing Arduino code
Sending sensor data to cloud

Purpose of the Activity:
This skill enables learners to interface temperature, humidity, and pressure sensors with an ESP32 Wi-Fi module and transmit real-time data to the Blynk cloud platform. The data can be monitored remotely through a web dashboard or mobile app, making it useful for weather monitoring, home automation, and IoT projects.

Steps Performed in this Activity:
1. Hardware Connections
Connect the DHT11 sensor to the ESP32 GPIO pins.
Ensure proper power supply (3.3V for ESP32, 3.3V/5V for sensors).
Use pull-up resistors where necessary
2. Software Setup
Install Arduino IDE (or use MicroPython on Thonny IDE).
Install required libraries (DHT, Adafruit BMP/BME, BlynkSimpleEsp32).
Configure Blynk project and get an authentication token.
3. Writing the Code
Initialize ESP32 and connect it to Wi-Fi.
Read temperature, humidity, and pressure from the sensor.
Send the data to Blynk cloud using Blynk.virtualWrite().
4. Upload and Run
Compile and upload the code to ESP32.
Monitor sensor values on the Blynk app.
5. Real-Time Monitoring
Use Blynk widgets to display live temperature, humidity, and pressure.
Enable graph visualization for tracking trends over time.
