Skill-3:
Aim: Interfacing Keypad, Pushbutton, Buzzer, and Display (LED, LCD, 8x8 Matrix LED) with Raspberry Pi
Skills and Competencies Acquired:
Understanding GPIO pins
Working with libraries like RPi.GPIO
Reading input from a pushbutton
Controlling output devices
Displaying text and patterns on LED
Writing Python scripts in RPi
Purpose of this Skill:
To interface various input and output devices with a Raspberry Pi, enabling users to build interactive projects. By mastering these interfaces, one can develop applications like security systems, interactive displays, embedded control systems, and IoT applications.

Resources Used in this Skill:
Raspberry Pi, pushbutton, keypad, LED, buzzer, LCD, 8x8 LED matrix, jumper wires, breadboard, Raspbian OS, Python, Geany Python IDE

Steps Performed in this Skill:

1. Interfacing a Pushbutton with Raspberry Pi:
Connect a pushbutton to the Raspberry Pi GPIO using a pull-up or pull-down resistor.
Write a Python script using the RPi.GPIO library to detect button presses.
Print messages or trigger actions (e.g., turning on an LED) upon button press.
2. Interfacing a Keypad with Raspberry Pi:
Use a 4x4 or 3x4 matrix keypad.
Connect the keypad rows and columns to the GPIO pins.
Write a Python script to scan key presses and decode the input using the Adafruit_MCP230xx library or custom logic.
3. Interfacing a Buzzer with Raspberry Pi:
Connect a piezo or active buzzer to a GPIO pin.
Use PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) to control sound patterns.
Write a Python script to generate beeps or tones on specific triggers.
4. Interfacing an LED with Raspberry Pi:
Connect an LED with a current-limiting resistor to a GPIO pin.
Write a Python script to turn the LED on/off or blink it in different patterns.
5. Interfacing an LCD Display with Raspberry Pi:
Use an I2C or parallel 16x2 LCD.
Connect the display to the Raspberry Piâ€™s I2C pins.
Install and use the Adafruit_CharLCD library for controlling the display.
Write a Python script to display text messages on the LCD.
6. Interfacing an 8x8 LED Matrix with Raspberry Pi:
Use a MAX7219-based 8x8 LED matrix.
Connect it using SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) pins.
Install and use the luma.led_matrix Python library to control the display.
Write a Python script to display patterns, scrolling text, or animations.
