Title: Interfacing ESP8266 with DHT11 Sensor and Uploading Data to ThingSpeak Webpage

Purpose of the Activity:
This activity aims to demonstrate the process of collecting environmental data (temperature, humidity, pressure) using sensors like DHT11 or BMP/BME280 and transmitting that data to ThingSpeak, a cloud-based IoT analytics platform. It builds hands-on skills in sensor interfacing, Wi-Fi-based communication using ESP8266, and cloud data visualization.

Steps Performed in This Activity:
1. Hardware Setup:
Connect DHT11 or BMP/BME sensor to the ESP8266 board.

2. Install below Libraries in Arduino IDE:
DHT sensor library
ThingSpeak library
ESP8266WiFi library

3. Setup ThingSpeak:
Create an account on ThingSpeak.
Create a new channel and add fields (e.g., temperature, humidity).
Note your Write API Key.

4. Write and Upload Arduino Code:
Connect ESP8266 to Wi-Fi.
Read sensor data.
Use ThingSpeak.writeField() to send data to the cloud.
Upload code and observe sensor data being updated in real-time on ThingSpeak dashboard.

5. Monitor and Validate Output:
Open Serial Monitor to check for connectivity and sensor reading.
Login to ThingSpeak and view live graphs.

Resources and Tools Used:
1. ESP8266 NodeMCU
2. DHT11 Sensor
3. Jumper wires
4. Breadboard
